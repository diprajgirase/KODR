Your approach is absolutely correct and deeply practical. Here’s why:

🔥 Why it works:
Real developers never solve problems in one go. We:

	•	Break problems into chunks (micro/macro).
	•	Solve parts we know → Google the rest → Test → Iterate.
	•	Build a mental map of how things connect (e.g., DOM + events + storage + async).

Teaching your students to think this way mirrors how real developers work. It builds problem-solving muscles, not just syntax memory.

Each question comes with a problem + macro and micro steps (detailed breakdown). These are all “developer-scenario” flavored — not textbook style.
